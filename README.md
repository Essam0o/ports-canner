A port scanner is a computer program or tool used to examine a computer or network for open ports. Ports are virtual endpoints for communication in a computer system, and they are identified by numerical values. They play a crucial role in facilitating various network services and applications.
# How it works
Here's a more detailed description of a port scanner:

    Purpose: Port scanners are primarily used for network reconnaissance and security assessment. They help network administrators and security professionals identify open ports on target systems. Open ports can be potential vulnerabilities, so understanding what ports are open is essential for securing a network.

    How It Works: Port scanners work by sending network requests to a range of port numbers on a target system or a range of IP addresses to see which ports respond. The response or lack thereof helps determine the state of each port: open, closed, or filtered (firewalled).
